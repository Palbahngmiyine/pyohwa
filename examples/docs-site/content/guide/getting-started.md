# Getting Started

Learn how to set up Pyohwa for your documentation project.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Required |
|------|---------|----------|
| Rust | 1.70+   | Yes      |

## Quick Start

Create a new project:

```bash
pyohwa init my-docs
cd my-docs
pyohwa dev
```

## Project Structure

A typical Pyohwa project looks like this:

```
